          As a young girl, math was my first love. I enjoyed the fact that it made sense and I learned to see it everywhere. However, as a young adult I wished that math could be more practical and applicable than what it seemed to be, and programming provided that for me. I developed the skill of abstract thinking and applied it in the design of computer programs.
          <br><br>
          Once I took an introduction to programming course in high school, I realized that I found what I was looking for. I attended <strong>Harper Community College</strong> and earned an <strong>associate's degree</strong> as a first step towards my goal. Afterwards, <strong>Lake Forest College</strong> offered me the opportunity to double <strong>major in mathematics and computer science</strong> thus fulfilling my younger-self's dreams. She is very proud of me.
          <br><br>
          In May of 2020 I earned my bachelor's degree and I am proud to call myself a computer scientist & a mathematician.

        <h4 class="text-center text-pink">Volunteerwork</h4>
        <p class="text-grey">
          To me, time is an invaluable gift. People cannot make more time, nor can they take back the time that they have given to others. Giving time has to be one of the most precious gifts there is.
          <br><br>
          My experience in volunteering is very broad, as there are many activities that I enjoy participating and all have very different audiences.
          I volunteered as <strong>math tutor</strong> for high school students. I served as a <strong>tour guide</strong> at Harper College for kids ranging from 2nd grade to 12th grade where they learned about the ample opportunities that higher eduaction can offer to everyone.
          <br><br>
          I have helped <strong>build houses</strong> with Habitat for Humanity and <strong>made meals</strong> at Feed My Starving Children.
          I <strong>modeled</strong> at a fashion show where I got to wear garments made by Harper's very own fashion department students. I also got to <strong>lead science events</strong> at various elementary schools that target underrepresented communities in the STEM field.
          <br><br>
          Everyone as a kid has the seed of curiousity, and somewhere along the line it gets lost. I just want to be a good person and help the seed in others grow.

        <h4 class="text-center text-pink">Hobbies</h4>
        <p class="text-grey">
          My hobbies include practicing water sports, such as swimming and water polo. Reading spanish novelists has a special place in my heart... watching rom-coms takes second.
          <br><br>
          I am a very family-oriented person, so I really enjoy family gatherings. My culture is very important to me, and maintaining these traditions in a different country is a fundamental part of who I am.
          <br><br>
          Other activities that I like are puzzles such as jigsaw, sudoku, and word search.
